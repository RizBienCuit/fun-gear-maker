# fun-gear-maker
python programm that makes the fitting gear with a stl gear

how to use:
your original gear has to be a svg file containing only one svg path containing only straight lines(l,m,z,h,v,L,M,Z,H,V). The svg file mustn't contain any transform.
your original gear's path has to be a star shaped polygon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-shaped_polygon) around zero(be careful the 0,0 point in inkscape is the
up left corner of the page.
The center of rotation of the two gears is the 0,0 point.
Then just run the program and follow the instructions.
On my computer with a 1000 precision this just takes ab out 10/20 seconds so if it's to long recheck your file.

If there's any problems or if you want to help me improve the program, just tell me

# fun-gear-maker
python programm that makes the fitting gear with a stl gear

how to use:
your original gear has to be a svg file containing only one svg path containing only straight lines(l,m,z,h,v,L,M,Z,H,V). The svg file mustn't contain any transform.
your original gear's path has to be a star shaped polygon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-shaped_polygon) around zero(be careful the 0,0 point in inkscape is the
up left corner of the page.
The center of rotation of the two gears is the 0,0 point.

If there's any problems or if you want to help me improve the programm, just tell me
